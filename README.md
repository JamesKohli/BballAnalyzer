BballAnalyzer
=============

This program can read seasons from basketball-reference.com, save them as csv, save them into a database, and calculate Elos for all teams over any number of years. It is run with the following parameters:

-d tells the program to download the appropriate years from basketball-reference.com instead of assuming they already exist
-y <year> specifies a year to run. This can be used multiple times.
